# Todo List App

This is a simple todo list app built using JavaScript and HTML. The app allows you to add and remove tasks, and it stores your tasks in local storage so you can access them even after closing the app.

## Usage
To use the app, simply open index.html in your web browser. You can add a new task by typing in the input field and pressing Enter. To remove a task, click on the task's "X" button.

## Local Storage
The app uses local storage to save your tasks, so you don't have to worry about losing them if you close the app. When you open the app again, your tasks will be loaded from local storage.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or bug reports, please submit them as issues on the GitHub repository.
