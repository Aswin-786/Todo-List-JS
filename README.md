# Todo-List-JS

Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share my latest project - a todo list app built using JavaScript! With this app, you can easily create and manage your daily tasks, making sure you don't forget anything important.

Using JavaScript, I was able to create a user-friendly interface and incorporate features such as task prioritization and due dates. I also used HTML and CSS to style the app and make it visually appealing.
